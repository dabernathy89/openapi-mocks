## What is openapi-mocks?

`openapi-mocks` is a TypeScript library that parses OpenAPI 3.0.x / 3.1.x documents
and generates realistic mock data and pre-built [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) v2 request handlers.

Get spec-compliant fake data for tests, stories, and local dev — all from a single OpenAPI source of truth.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install openapi-mocks
```

```ts
import { createMockClient } from 'openapi-mocks';

const client = createMockClient('./openapi.yaml');

// Generate mock data
const data = await client.data();

// Generate MSW handlers (requires msw to be installed)
const handlers = await client.handlers({ baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com' });
```
