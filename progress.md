## Codebase Patterns
- Root tsconfig.json must exclude `planning/` — it contains example .ts files that import unresolved modules
- `packages/openapi-mocks/src/index.ts` placeholder is required for typecheck to find inputs
- pnpm workspace: `packages/*` and `docs` are workspace members; `examples/*` are NOT (intentionally standalone)
- Root typecheck script: `tsc --noEmit` (relies on root tsconfig.json)
- pnpm version in use: 10.26.1; TypeScript version: 5.9.3

## 2026-02-18 - US-001
- What was implemented: Initialized pnpm monorepo structure with all required workspace configuration
- Files changed:
  - `package.json` (root) — private monorepo with pnpm@10.26.1, build/test/typecheck scripts
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — lists `packages/*` and `docs` as workspace members
  - `tsconfig.json` (root) — strict mode, excludes planning/ and docs/ and examples/
  - `.gitignore` — added `.astro/`, `.turbo/` entries
  - `.npmrc` — `shamefully-hoist=false`
  - `packages/openapi-mocks/package.json` — placeholder with name, version, type: module
  - `packages/openapi-mocks/src/index.ts` — minimal placeholder export
  - `docs/package.json` — private placeholder
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` — generated by pnpm install
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `planning/` directory contains example .ts files referencing `openapi-mocks` and `@playwright/test` (not installed). Always exclude it from the root tsconfig.
  - A non-empty `packages/openapi-mocks/src/index.ts` is needed to avoid `TS18003: No inputs were found` on the root typecheck.
  - The `examples/` directory is intentionally NOT a workspace member per CLAUDE.md — keep it out of pnpm-workspace.yaml.
