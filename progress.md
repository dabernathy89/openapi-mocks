## Codebase Patterns
- Root tsconfig.json must exclude `planning/` — it contains example .ts files that import unresolved modules
- `packages/openapi-mocks/src/index.ts` placeholder is required for typecheck to find inputs
- pnpm workspace: `packages/*` and `docs` are workspace members; `examples/*` are NOT (intentionally standalone)
- Root typecheck script: `tsc --noEmit` (relies on root tsconfig.json)
- pnpm version in use: 10.26.1; TypeScript version: 5.9.3
- Root tsconfig includes `"types": ["node"]` and root has `@types/node` — needed because vite.config.ts files are picked up by root typecheck and require Node globals
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `onlyBuiltDependencies: [esbuild]` allows esbuild postinstall script (required for Vite to work)
- Vite config uses `new URL('src/index.ts', import.meta.url).pathname` instead of `__dirname` (ESM-native approach, no `node:path` import needed)

## 2026-02-18 - US-001
- What was implemented: Initialized pnpm monorepo structure with all required workspace configuration
- Files changed:
  - `package.json` (root) — private monorepo with pnpm@10.26.1, build/test/typecheck scripts
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — lists `packages/*` and `docs` as workspace members
  - `tsconfig.json` (root) — strict mode, excludes planning/ and docs/ and examples/
  - `.gitignore` — added `.astro/`, `.turbo/` entries
  - `.npmrc` — `shamefully-hoist=false`
  - `packages/openapi-mocks/package.json` — placeholder with name, version, type: module
  - `packages/openapi-mocks/src/index.ts` — minimal placeholder export
  - `docs/package.json` — private placeholder
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` — generated by pnpm install
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `planning/` directory contains example .ts files referencing `openapi-mocks` and `@playwright/test` (not installed). Always exclude it from the root tsconfig.
  - A non-empty `packages/openapi-mocks/src/index.ts` is needed to avoid `TS18003: No inputs were found` on the root typecheck.
  - The `examples/` directory is intentionally NOT a workspace member per CLAUDE.md — keep it out of pnpm-workspace.yaml.

## 2026-02-18 - US-002
- What was implemented: Configured Vite library build for `openapi-mocks` package
- Files changed:
  - `packages/openapi-mocks/vite.config.ts` — Vite library mode config with ESM + CJS outputs, vite-plugin-dts for declarations
  - `packages/openapi-mocks/tsconfig.json` — extends root tsconfig, sets rootDir/outDir for declarations
  - `packages/openapi-mocks/package.json` — added `exports` map (types/import/require), `main`, `module`, `types`, `files`, and `build`/`typecheck` scripts
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — added `onlyBuiltDependencies: [esbuild]` to allow esbuild postinstall
  - `tsconfig.json` (root) — added `"types": ["node"]` so vite.config.ts Node globals typecheck correctly
  - `package.json` (root) — added `@types/node` as devDependency
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` — updated with new dependencies (vite, vite-plugin-dts, typescript, @types/node)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - esbuild (Vite's bundler) requires a postinstall script; must add to `onlyBuiltDependencies` in pnpm-workspace.yaml
  - When using `import.meta.url` in vite.config.ts, the root tsconfig needs `@types/node` AND `"types": ["node"]` — otherwise `import.meta.url` is not recognized
  - Vite 7 no longer shows "types condition order" warning once `types` is first in the exports map — put `types` before `import` and `require`
  - `vite-plugin-dts` generates `.d.ts` and `.d.ts.map` files alongside the JS output automatically

## 2026-02-18 - US-003
- What was implemented: Configured Vitest for the library package with a smoke test
- Files changed:
  - `packages/openapi-mocks/vitest.config.ts` — Vitest config with `include` pattern for `src/**/*.test.ts` and `src/__tests__/**/*.test.ts`
  - `packages/openapi-mocks/src/__tests__/smoke.test.ts` — trivial smoke test asserting `true === true`
  - `packages/openapi-mocks/package.json` — added `test` script (`vitest run`) and `vitest` devDependency
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` — updated with vitest and dependencies
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vitest version 3.x is current (vitest@^3.2.4 installed fine)
  - `vitest run` (not `vitest`) is the correct non-interactive script for CI/package scripts
  - Separate `vitest.config.ts` keeps concerns clean — no need to merge into vite.config.ts
  - Root `pnpm -r test` automatically picks up the package test script without any root config changes
